Steps:
- Read file and get info on backup sets. For each database, select the latest backupset (highest Position)
- For each backup set get info on files
- Restore either:
    - Interactively - asking for a relocation path of a file.
      If user wants relocation - memorize old and new dir names and use that info next time.
      If user selected relocation - ask if it is selected for the current DB only or for all subsequent DBs
    - Non-Interactively - try to guess on file paths by looking into current DB config
      If there is no such file - try to use the path from backup
      Non-interactive restore can be multithreaded

The script will use REPLACE and restore backup sets of type Database.
